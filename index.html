            <p class="first">
                I am a passionate web developer 
                <br>with 12 years of experience building <br>
                virtual platforms for organizations 
                <br>at a professional level. <br>
                My experience with development 
                <br>software is primarily JavaScript and Ajax, <br>
                but I am also comfortable using Perl, 
                <br>C++, PHP, and Java, among others.<br>
                I am creative and detail-oriented 
                <br>in designing platforms that are functional <br>
                and user-friendly.I have a strong 
                <br>understanding of the use of SEO and social<br> 
                media in building brand awareness and 
                <br>gaining visibility in search engine rankings.<br> 
                I also value the use of mobile programming 
                <br>to design a well-rounded platform that <br>
                caters to the unique needs of each customer I serve.
